## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
I have been using Pomodoro the entire time, so it hasn't been any different. The Pomodoro technique has really helped me to be able to focus for longer periods of time.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I didn't really set intentions before using Pomodoro. I've been mostly just picking a part of my project to do and then going through Pomodoro blocks till it's done.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A hash is like an array but it stores key value pairs rather than being indexed integers.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```ruby

pet_store = {
  dog_food: 15,
  cat_food: 15,
  fish_food: 10,
  dog_toys: 27,
  cat_toys: 38,
  fish_tanks: 6,
}

```

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`#{states["IA"]}`

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`states.keys` and `states.values`

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
We might use a hash when storing user data on an application. An array would be limited to only one kind of data, so a hash would be more appropriate.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
None that I can think of currently.
