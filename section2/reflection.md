## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
The Growth Mindset resonated with me because that is what led me to Turing in the first place. The idea of learning how to code as a way to learn how to learn more efficiently

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
One of the techniques mentioned in the video was self-analysis, noticing a thought or thought pattern and seeing if it is helping me to grow and learn or not. I tend to stray towards a fixed mindset when the perceived effort of a task is greater than the effort I would like to put towards that task, which is why self-analysis was the most important aspect of the growth mindset for me to learn first.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement uses variables to give a boolean answer.
```ruby
def number_of_apples(apples)
  if apples < 1
    puts "You don't have any apples"
  elsif apples == 1
    puts "You have an apple"
  elsif apples >= 2
    puts "You have apples! Share with your friends!"
  end
end
```
4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
An if statement can check a variable for a specific answer or a range.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
`if (conditional) then (code)`

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
Use elsif for any specific additional if statements and else for anything else.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
`if (conditional) do (code)
elsif (conditional) do (code)
else do (code)`
